# Front-End Developer Challenge: E-Commerce Shopping Page

## Introduction

In this challenge, you are tasked with building a simplified e-commerce shopping page with fundamental cart functionality. This project should be developed using the React or Vuejs ecosystem.

## Objectives

Your goal is to implement two main pages:

1. **Gallery Page**: A product showcase where users can browse and select items.
2. **Cart Page**: Displays items added to the cart by the user.

The product data is provided in a `db.json` file. While a clean and organized UI layout is expected, the focus of the evaluation is not on UI design.

## Main Functionality

### Gallery Page

1. **Navbar**:

   - Features a Cart Menu.
   - Includes a badge indicating the number of items in the cart.
   - Clicking on the Cart Menu displays a list of products added to the cart, or a message if the cart is empty.
   - A Checkout button that navigates to the Cart Page.

2. **Products List**:

   - Displays a list of products with images, titles, and prices.
   - Each product has an 'Add to Cart' button.
   - Clicking on a product opens a modal with more detailed information.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Client-side pagination to navigate through the product list.

### Cart Page

- Lists the products added to the cart.
- Additional features or functionalities in this page will be considered a plus.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Responsive Design**: The layout should be responsive, with a desktop version for resolutions â‰¥ 960 px and a mobile version for resolutions < 960 px.
- **Functionality**: Implementation of the specified features.
- **Code Quality**: Including style, structure, and cleanliness.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise project documentation.
- **Git Practices**: Descriptive and organized Git commit messages.
- **Code Linting**: Adherence to standard coding conventions and linting rules.
- **Setup Process**: The ease of setting up the project for development and testing.

## Additional Considerations

- **State Management**: Demonstrate effective state management strategies (Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries).
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and user feedback for any asynchronous operations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques used to optimize performance, especially with respect to the rendering of the product list.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the application is accessible to as wide an audience as possible.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your components using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Submission

Submit your project as a repository link on GitHub. Ensure the README file includes setup instructions, project overview, and any other relevant information.

We look forward to seeing your creative approach to solving this challenge and your ability to build a functional and user-friendly e-commerce interface with React. Good luck!
